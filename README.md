# 📊 Hackathon_Abdelghafour

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **telecom customer churn analysis and prediction project** created as part of a **hackathon challenge**.  
The goal is to explore customer behavior, identify patterns associated with churn, and build a model that can help telecom companies **predict which customers are likely to leave**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Telecom companies often lose customers (churn) due to competition or poor service.  
This project analyzes the **Telecom Customers Churn dataset** and applies machine learning techniques to:  
1. Understand factors influencing churn  
2. Create a predictive model  
3. Evaluate model performance
